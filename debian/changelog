carta-frontend-beta (3.0+2021.8.10-1~focal1) focal; urgency=medium

  * Bumped version to 3.0.0-beta.1.
  * Added:
    - The image view toolbar can be minimized to prevent it from hiding the 
      image view.
    - The last used directory can now be preserved across CARTA sessions.
    - The ability to view multiple images at once in a multi-panel view has been 
      added.
    - Boolean columns are now supported in FITS and VOTable catalogs.
    - Line and poly-line regions can be created. They currently do not have any
      associated analytic features, but will be used for upcoming PV image 
      features.
    - Additional preferences added: smooth updates of the overlay and adjusting 
      the visibility of the cursor overlay.
    - The image, region and Stokes value can now be changed on the spatial 
      profiler.
    - Multiple images can now be loaded via query parameters, using 
      ?files=[a,b,c].
    - The Stokes value can be changed on statistics and histogram widgets.
    - A cursor widget has been added, which displays the cursor position and 
      value for all open images.
    - An experimental JavaScript-based code snippets feature has been added, for 
      scripting CARTA from the frontend. Snippets can be saved, edited and 
      re-executed. The feature can be enabled in the preferences dialog.
    - Added a customizable colorbar to the image view widget, with an 
      interactive mode that highlights pixels above a threshold.
    - A pixel grid is now displayed at high zoom levels. This can be disabled in 
      the image view settings.
  * Changed:
    - The image overlay title can now be customised on a per-image basis.
    - The polarization string (e.g. "Stokes I") is shown instead of the index 
      (e.g. 0).
    - The spectral line query widget now checks the Splatalogue server before 
      displaying.
    - Optimisations to catalog rendering with a large number of data points.
    - Directories displayed in the file browser now have item count and modified 
      date entries.

    - Fixed issue with spectral-matched images not being refreshed (#1571).
    - Fixed issue with image tiles smaller than 4x4 pixels (#1365 and #1485).
    - Fixed crash when region list is initially too small (#1598).
    - Fixed region offset errors when matching and unmatching images (#1293).
    - Fixes progress indicator when displaying multiple spectral profiles 
      (#1429)
    - Fixed minor input issues with the catalog widget (#1505 and #1544).
